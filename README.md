# The Bean Machine

In this portfolio project, you'll build a minimal landing page for an coffee bean shop.

This mockup has 4 main parts: the navigation, banner, main section and the footer.

## Mockups

Desktop:

## Getting Started Notes

- You're given a decent start in terms of the HTML markup, but not much in the way of styles. You'll be expected to edit `style.css` to implement the styles. 

- Don't worry too much about "best practices". Later in this course, we'll see how to create scalable encapsulated styles. For now, the goal is simply to implement the designs in the screenshots, with whatever organizational strategy comes most naturally to you.

- Note about the layout: flow-layout and box-model. For the "Special offers" section see how you can use flexbox to build the cards and align them.
- 
- It's important to be comfortable with these primitives (padding, border and margin) before moving on to more-complex subjects.


- **Pay close attention to .** using the right HTML markup: <nav> for the navigation, <footer> for the footer etc. Make sure you use the https://validator.w3.org/ markup validator if you're not sure about the structure. 

## Design tokens

We want to make sure that our site has a consistent look and feel, that's why we use _design tokens_.


**If you find it difficult to use these tokens, or if you're not able to achieve a result you're happy with, don't worry about it.** 

### Spacing

This landing page uses an 8px unit. This will help you to determine the size of padding and margin. Start with 16px and then adjust if you want more space (24px and up) or less (8px)

- `8px`
- `16px`
- `24px`
- `32px`
- `48px`
- `64px`
- `96px`
- `128px`

When it comes to max widths (eg. the maximum width of the card), arbitrary values can be used.

### Font

1 font is used in this project: `Lato`. It is already included in the stylesheet.

The base font size is 16px, which reflect the typography in the following:

- `<h1>` - `40px`
- `<h2>` - `36px`
- `<p>` - `16px`

### Color palette

Primary (pink):

- `#FF5678`

Secondary (green):

- `#149770`

Grays:

- `#000000` (black)
- `#917D6E` (dark)
- `#F6F2EF` (medium)
- `#917D6E` (light)
- `#FFFFFF` (white)
